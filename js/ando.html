<h2>Islamic Calligraphy</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Islamic calligraphy is the art of using handwriting in languages that use the Arabic alphabet or alphabets of Arabic origin. It includes Arabic, Persian, Ottoman, Afghan, Pakistani and Indian calligraphy. Calligraphy is known in Arabic as khatt Arabi (خط عربي) which means Arabic lines, designs.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>The development of Islamic Calligraphy is inextricably linked with the Quran, and chapters and passages quoted from the Qur'an are the most common sources on which Islamic Calligraphy is based. Although the use of painting to depict people and animals is not explicitly forbidden by the Qur'an, paintings are traditionally restricted to Islamic texts to prevent idolatry. In the ancient world, painters often bypassed legal barriers by using tiny text to create lines and images. Calligraphy in Muslim society is both a valuable art form and consistent with religious ethics. An old Arabic aphorism illustrates this point by emphasizing "Purity of words is purity of soul".</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Anyway, Islamic Calligraphy is not too strictly limited to religious subjects, things, and objects. Like other forms of Islamic art, calligraphy also encompasses a wide range of works created from various types of writing The prevalence of calligraphy in Islamic art is not directly related from the non-idol tradition, rather, it reflects the central role played by the view of writing and writing in Islam It is noteworthy that, in one case, the prophet Muhammad is said to have declared this sentence: "The first thing God made was a pen".</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Islamic calligraphy developed from two main styles: Kufic and Nashk. Each style has several variations as well as distinctive local styles. Arabic and Persian calligraphy was later integrated into Modern art, beginning in the post-colonial period in the Middle East.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Tools and means</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The traditional calligraphy writing tool of Islamic calligraphers is the qalam, a type of pen usually made from reed or bamboo. Ink is usually colored and selected so that the intensity varies over a wide range, thereby creating dynamics and displacement in the text. Some styles use metal-tipped pens.</p>

<div>
<p>Islamic calligraphy also uses more decorative media than paper such as tiles, vases, carpets or stones. Before paper was invented, papyrus and parchment were used for writing. During the ninth century, an influx of paper from China revolutionized calligraphy. While the monasteries in Europe at that time kept a few dozen volumes, libraries in the Islamic World often kept hundreds or even thousands of volumes.</p>

<h3>Kufic</h3>

<p>Kufic is the oldest form of Arabic script. The Kufic style emphasizes hard and angular strokes, expressed as an improved form of the Nabataean script.[10] The original Kufic script consisted of 17 letters and had no diacritics consisting of dots and tones. The diacritics were added in the 7th century to help readers recognize the pronunciation of the Qur'an and other important texts,
    increasing the number of Arabic letters to 28 Although disputed by some scholars, the Kufic script is thought to have developed around the end of the 7th century in Kufa, Iraq - from which the word Kufic was derived.[12] This style was later developed into several variations; including flower form, leaf form, fold form, spiral form, contour form and square form. Due to the straight and ordered nature of the Kufic script, it is frequently used in decorative stone carvings or on coins.[13] Kufic is a style used for copying the Quran from the 8th to 10th centuries and fell out of common use in the 12th century when the Nashk style became more useful.</p>
</div>
    <div>
<h3>Nashk</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Diwani_Izzet_al_Karkuki.jpg/200px-Diwani_Izzet_al_Karkuki.jpg" class="cangiua" alt="ảnh thư pháp">
<p>The use of cursive in Arabic coexists with the Kufic script, and historically cursive has often been used for informal purposes. With the rise of Islam, a new type of script needed to be used to match the pace of conversion, with a distinctly cursive cursive, Nashk, first appearing in the 10th century. Nashk means "" copy", it became the standard word for recording books and manuscripts. This type of script is the most common among other styles, used in the Qur'an, state documents, and private correspondence. Nashk became the cornerstone of the Arab printing industry.</p>
<p>The standardization of the Nashk style was proposed by Ibn Muqla (886 - 940) and later developed by Abu Hayan at-Tawhidi (d. Ibn Muqla is highly regarded in Islamic calligraphy as the inventor of the Nashk style, although this is unlikely to be the case. Since Ibn Muqla wrote clearly circular letters, many scholars have abandoned the conclusion that he invented the script. Ibn al-Bawwab, a student of Ibn Muqla, is believed to be the real creator of Nashk. Anyway, Ibn Muqla established a system of rules and proportions to write the shape of letters, using the letter alif as height - x.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
<h4>Variations of the Nashk style include:</h4>
<p> 1: Thuluth was developed in the 10th century and later refined by Ahmad Tayyib Shah. Letters in this style have long vertical lines and wide spacing.</p>
<p>2: Reqa is a type of script that evolved from Nashk and Thuluth, first appearing in the 10th century. The shape of the letter is simple with short strokes and small flower strokes.</p>
<p>3: Muhaqqaq is the majestic style used by skilled calligraphers. It is considered as one of the most beautiful typefaces and also the most difficult type to represent. </p>
