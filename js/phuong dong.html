In Asian calligraphy art, there are 5 writing styles: Chan (also known as Khai), Trien, Le, Hanh and Thao with their own specific rules of lines and expression.

        The Chinese believe that Ly Tu, the prime minister of the Qin court, was the originator of the art of calligraphy because he was the one who was assigned the task of reforming and unifying writing after Qin Shi Huang annexed the countries. other small countries to bring China into a unified country[citation needed]. Over the following dynasties, history books have recorded the appearance of famous calligraphers (who wrote beautiful letters), such as Vuong Hy Chi (Dong Jin Dynasty) or Qi Bach Thach (Qing Dynasty). .

        <p>Until now, in the history of Vietnam, there is not completely an official mention of an art called Calligraphy and an official title such as Calligrapher or Calligrapher for those who work in Vietnam. In this field, there is only the concept of good handwriting and good handwriting. In different periods, there were recognized writers of beautiful letters such as Ly Nhan Tong of the Ly dynasty, Nguyen Dinh Gioi of the Tran Dynasty, Bui Dinh Kien of the Le Dynasty or Cao Ba Quat of the Nguyen Dynasty.</p>

    <h2>Calligraphy in Han and Nom</h2>
    <div class="content-five">
    <p>Vietnam belongs to the East Asian cultural region, so Chinese calligraphy and Nom script are generally similar to those of China. However, some documents such as Kien Van Tieu Luc by Le Quy Don or Vu Trung Commentary by Pham Dinh Ho also briefly mention and distinguish the Chinese writing style of Vietnamese and Northern people.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-six">
    <p>The famous poet of the Le-Nguyen Dynasty Pham Dinh Ho mentioned a writing style of the Southern people under the Le that he called Nam Tu and he compared it with the writing style of the Northern people, which he called Bac Tu
        . This style of writing is still seen on many ordinations, epitaphs, etc. left from the Le Dynasty. Scholar Nguyen Su said that in order to achieve the unification of the Southern script, the role of King Le Thanh Tong in the administrative reform he proposed[2] must be mentioned. The Dai Viet historical records of the Toan Thu recorded the decrees on the unification of mandarin writing style as follows: in the 9th year of Quang Thuan: "The Decree of Le Bo regulates the forms of folk writing and promulgates it to the world." ;
        The 8th year of Hong Duc: "The decree of the royal guards, using uppercase letters, must be respectfully observed and implemented." The characteristic of administrative writing style of the Le dynasty was that the stroke was flat, straight, hiding the head and the tail, the last strokes often tended to be pushed upwards and later on, this trend became more and more pompous and the difficulty in writing was high. than in the Mac and Le Trung Hung dynasties.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-sevent">
    <p>In Le Trung Hung's time, this Southern script was perfected with the feature of "curved head and legs turned"[1], using a dangerous pen, the combination is tight inward, seemingly following the circle, not the figure. square like the usual Khai word[2]. Originating from administrative use, but this style of writing gradually was used for both diaphragms, couplets, epitaphs, etc. in pagodas and almost dominated the letters of the Le Trung Hung period.
        Pham Dinh Ho said: "...the papers in public places are used exclusively in the Southern script. At first it was the folk room made forged, then according to the pattern, it created a mandarin script. Who follows it? That style of writing, every six years, the matriculation exam is added as a footnote in the dental office"[3]. According to the Viet History Compendium, during the Le dynasty, the writing exam consisted of 3 parts: Dai Thu, Lady and Lenh Thu. This mentioned command letter style may be the word used in decrees and administrative regulations.
        At the end of the Le Dynasty, Lord Trinh Sam's love of the Northern script led to a return of calligraphy to a more liberal style, dispelling a long period of using only a stereotyped native script. The Southern writing style of the Le dynasty, although it came from the pragmatic purpose of mandarin's writing, has also created a unique artistic mark for Vietnamese calligraphy in the overall Asian classical literature.</p>

    <div class="content-nine">
